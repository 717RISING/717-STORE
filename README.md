## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.x or higher)
-   pnpm (recommended, but npm/yarn also work)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone https://github.com/717RISING/717-STORE.git
    cd 717-STORE
    \`\`\`

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    \`\`\`bash
    pnpm install
    # or
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    \`\`\`

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your environment variables.
    Example:
    \`\`\`env
    # For AI SDK (if using OpenAI)
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

    # For email service (if using Nodemailer, replace with your SMTP details)
    # SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
    # SMTP_PORT=587
    # SMTP_SECURE=false
    # SMTP_USER=your_email@example.com
    # SMTP_PASS=your_email_password
    # EMAIL_FROM="717 Store <no-reply@717store.com>"

    # Base URL for emails/links (adjust for production)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
    \`\`\`
    *Note: This project uses mock data for database interactions and email sending for simplicity. For a production environment, you would integrate with a real database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and a transactional email service.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    \`\`\`bash
    pnpm dev
    # or
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    \`\`\`

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
